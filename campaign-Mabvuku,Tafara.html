        <p>
            On the 5th of June we managed to host a clean-up campaign in Mabvuku/Tafara in collaboration with
            various stakeholders, organisations, stakeholders, Councillor’s, District Office, and Community
            Development Committee.<br><br>
            One of our partners (AHF Zimbabwe) who were at the program managed to pitch a tent and do HIV
            testing, STI screening and treatment, and Condoms distribution:
            The statics for the service which AHF Zimbabwe delivered to the community were as follow:
        </p>

        <h3>Young People’s Power (AHF Zimbabwe) </h3>
        <p>25 tested HIV<br>
            25 screened for STI<br>
            4 had symptoms and got referred for treatment<br>
            48 pads got distributed to young girls.<br><br>

            At the program there was various groups including newly formed group of Community Power Voices
            (CPV) which is under AHF Zimbabwe. They also managed to advocate for various topics include safe
            sex, saying no to drugs, early child marriages etc. were helped them to get tip offs on drug dealers
            which are around Mabvuku and also they distribute nearly 500 male condoms to money changers,
            mahwindi, car wash, and into car parks.
        </p>

        <h3>Succeses of the program</h3>
        <p>We have managed to create a strong engagement between the community and its service
            deliveries which were at the program, which helped the community to know the exactly
            place to go when they need help which was the major reason for the clean-up campaign.
