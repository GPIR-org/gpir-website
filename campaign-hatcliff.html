        <p>
            On the 26th of September 2024, representatives of the International Wellness Center
            conducted free voluntary urine drug testing at Hatcliff Community Center.<br>

            A total of 10 individuals, all males between the ages of 22-36 submitted urine samples for testing.<br>
            The testing method used was a 6-drug panel that is specific for the folloing drugs of abuse:
        </p>

        <h3>Drugs Tested</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Methamphetamine</li>
            <li>Cocaine</li>
            <li>Opiates</li>
            <li>Oxycodone</li>
            <li>Benzodiazepines</li>
            <li>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>THC was the only drug detected among the volunteers, of which 3 out of the 10 individuals tested positive.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview of THC</h3>
        <p>THC is the main psychoactive drug found in the Cannabis plant, also known as marijuana, weed,skunk, chamba
            and mbanje. The Cannabis plant is grown and cultivated in illicit farms throughout Zimbabwe. A chemically
            diverse and hetereogenus substance, cannabis is addictive and contains, in addition to THC, 483 other
            compounds 65 of which also includes cannabidiol(CBD). THC can be consumed via smoking the dried and crushed
            cannabis buds of purified THC crystals, or through oral ingestion.<br>

            Cannabis has various physical and mental effects which include:
        <ul>
            <li>euphoria</li>
            <li>altered states of mind</li>
            <li>altered sense of time</li>
            <li>difficulty concentrating</li>
            <li>impaired short-term memory</li>
            <Li>impaired body movement (balance and fine motor control)</Li>
            <li>relaxation</li>
            <li>increased appetite</li>
        </ul>

        At high doses more concerning symptoms including anxiety, paranoia, delusions (including ideas of
        reference), hallucinations and overt psychosis.
        After alcohol, THC is the most common and widely abused illicit drug in Zimbabwe. It is particularly
        problematic in that it often acts as a gateway to the abuse of harder, more dangerous drugs such as
        methamphetamine (crystal meth); the drug most notorious among the nation’s youth today.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p> Drug and substance abuse is clearly a very serious epidemic plaguing Zimbabwe’s population and in
            particular its youth. We as the International Wellness center would like to thank Global Health, Harare
            City Council and Hatcliff Community Center for accommodating our participation in this event and
            facilitating this particular outreach in service of our community.
